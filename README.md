# New here? No idea what to contribute to this project?
Here a list of tasks you could do:
1. Add social media icons to the footer on both the html files
2. Do the navigation bar a little better
3. Make sure the website is reponsive
4. If you think the pages are too blank, add some impressive backgrounds to it. If you are adding any images, make sure it is not a copyrighted one. Choose the images from unsplash.com or freepik.com or any other equivalent platform.
5. Add validation to the form in books.html
